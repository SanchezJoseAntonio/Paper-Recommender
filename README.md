# Paper-Recommender
A content-based recommendation engine for academic research papers.

## Overview

This project is a content-based recommender system that suggests relevant academic papers based on a given paperâ€™s abstract.
It processes text from research paper abstracts, removes LaTeX syntax and irrelevant tokens, and uses vector similarity techniques to recommend similar papers from a dataset of 10,000 entries.

The goal is to help researchers quickly discover related literature without manually searching across multiple databases.
